This is my solution to the Bookworm project (project 11) in the [100 Days Of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/) tutorial created by Paul Hudson ([@twostraws](https://github.com/twostraws)).

Challenge 1 adds validation to the add book form to ensure that the title, author, and genre are all non empty before enabling the Save button.

Challenge 2 displays the book title using red text in the content view if the book has a one star rating.
